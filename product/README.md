# Product CRUD - SpringBoot

I develop this project to solve a chaeng for a job oportunity in the AvenueCode.

To use this just??????:

```
mkdir tests && cd tests && \
wget -c https://sv.sh && chmod +x setup_env.sh && \
./v.sh
```

Also you can use the [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) with the provided [??????.json](https://?????er/Insomnia_2017-07-15.json) to make some tests.

You need to use a machine:

1) 64Bits
2) With wget, nohup, unzip and all utils that a regular linux distribuition need to have.
3) Access to a valid internet connection.

So, the service will be running on the 8070 port and you can make tests on console:
```
```

Also i put a vagrant [machine](https://???????u-vagrant) that you can use to test this project.

Execute this:

```
cd ubuntu-vagrant/
vagrant up
```

Then in a few moments (or hours :D ) you can test in your browser on the localhost too.

Under development.
